1. Connect-4 is a 2 player board game. The board size is 6 x 7.
2. Each player has got 21 coins of different colors, say, Blue and Red.
3. The two players take chances alternatively to place coins in the board (kept vertical).
4. The coins will stack up on each other (and not float, duh, gravity!).
5. The player who connects 4 coins (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) first, wins.
6. Also, this game is called FourPlay in Thailand for obvious reasons, where I saw this for first time.
7. If you prefer colored words in the console while playing, you can use a powerful Jetbrains plugin http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7125-grep-console
